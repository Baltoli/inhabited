# Styles

Rationale and documentation for how we will style the app.

* Use normalize.css to reset everything to defaults - the layout isn't complex
  so we shouldn't need a bigger framework to get things done initially. If
  things start to grow bigger / the scope of the app changes we can include
  more.
